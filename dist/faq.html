An IBAN is different from a SWIFT code (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) as it identifies an <span class="bold italic">dividual account</span> involved in the cross-border payment. A SWIFT code helps overseas banks to identify which <span class="bold italic">specific bank</span>  to send money to.</p>
                                <p class="faqItems__panelText ">The main advantage of IBAN is fast processing of electronic transactions with minimum delays and extra costs which reduces the risk of propagating transcription errors. </p>
                                <p class="faqItems__panelText ">Currently, about 54 countries of the European Union are using IBAN plus Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Hungary, and others. </p>
